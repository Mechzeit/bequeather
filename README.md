# Bequeather - Server
A(*nother*) abstracted TCP Socket server which will be used to transmit files - written for Python 3.*

## Install
TBA.

## Usage
TBA.

## Why?
1. I may have a constant hankering to ensure my garage door is closed; armed with a webcam & Raspberry Pi this server will enable me to mentally soothe my garage door related woes.
2. It's a relatively simple project to bring myself back into Python-mode after too working with too much PHP.

## Roadmap/Ideas
* Mobile application (Android only, most likely)
* Support streaming from a live feed and/or streaming video formats
* Different server 'adapters'
  * Web Socket
  * UDP(Anyone?)
  * HTTP
* Client libraries (not explicitly related to this repository)

## Notes
* This will be my first publically available Python 3 module
* Also my first time jumping back into Python after an unintended hiatus. Please be gentle :)
